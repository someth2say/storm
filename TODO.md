- config sanity checks
- Enable time limit instead of request count limit
- Proper testing
- Proper docs (maybe using Antora?)
- Duration stats: confidence intervals
- stat: value for a single header, i.e headervalue(server)
- Implement HTTP authentication (basic?)
- Add CI and automatic releases.
- Study impact of calculating stat steps and consider removing them and leaving only the final calculations.
